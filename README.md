# Resistance

Mobile-friendly online adaptation of party card game Resistance built with Node.js and a PostgreSQL database. Uses the Socket.IO JavaScript library to implement the game's real-time updating and chat features.

Currently only limited to five players and the UI is rather plain, but it works. 

I wrote this rather early into my GA course and if I were to make this now I'd probably do it with React and find a better way to write the DB queries, which was probably the most tedious part of the project. Maybe explore GraphQL?
