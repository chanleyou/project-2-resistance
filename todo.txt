BUGS:

lobby number of players display doesn't work
after 'no' vote, players chosen remain on screen for next player that chooses players ??? (need to repro)

TBD

	- players should only be able to see lobbies that 1) are open OR 2) they are in

Laundry List:

	- Fix width/height of UI elements instead of having them jump around when they come in/out (or set visibility: hidden instead of display: none)
	- Persistent chat
	- Game logs (who choose who for mission, who voted on what, etc.)

	- Make game look better
	-	Admin dashboard (remove completed/inactive games)
