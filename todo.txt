Each message should only append a New chatline Element (instead of reloading the entire chat )

	- Fix width/height of UI elements instead of having them jump around when they come in/out (or set visibility: hidden instead of display: none)
	- Persistent chat (DONE)
	- Game logs (who choose who for mission, who voted on what, etc.)

	- Make game look better
	-	Admin dashboard (remove completed/inactive games)
